Hello git :-)

Protocols
  Local Protocol  - git clone file:///opt/git/project.git
                  - got clone /opt/git/project.git  //faster
                  - PROS: simple, file permission, network access
                  - CONS: you must be always connected to share
  HTTP  - older 1.6.6 - dump HTTP (Read only)
                                    - simplicity (git dir in HTTP-document-root + post-update-hook)
                                    
        - newer 1.6.6 - SMART HTTP - simmilar to SSH
                                    - authentitcation
        - git clone https://....
        - PROS: authentication - easy for users (no SSH keys neeeded)
                commonly opened protocol in company firewalls
        - CONS: difficult setup          
                difficult caching credentials on user side
  SSH - most common, becase SSH is setted on most unix servers
        - git clone ssh://....
        - git clone user@server:....
        - PROS: relatively easy to set up , encrypted and secure, authentication
                 efficiant - compact transfered data
        - CONS: no anonymous access (for RO acces its needed to use other protocol)
  GIT - special daemon, port 9418
        - no authentication    
        - git-daemon-export-ok file
        - PROS - fastest
        - CONS - no authentication, useful only for RO access, most difficult to set up
